Azure Endâ€‘toâ€‘End Data Engineering Project
A comprehensive endâ€‘toâ€‘end data engineering pipeline built on Azure, incorporating real-time ingestion, transformation, structured storage, data modeling, and dashboardingâ€”designed for production-grade workloads and interview readiness.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Azure Data Factory (ADF) for ingestion & orchestration

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) as data lake

Azure Databricks (PySpark, Autoloader, Delta Live Tables)

Delta Lake with Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)

Handling of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD1/SCD2)

Spark Structured Streaming for real-time data

Databricks Unity Catalog for governance

Dimensional modeling / Star Schema for BI

Azure Synapse Analytics Serverless SQL

Power BI dashboards with secure Key Vault + AAD auth
