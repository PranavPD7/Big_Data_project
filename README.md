Azure Endâ€‘toâ€‘End Data Engineering Project
A comprehensive endâ€‘toâ€‘end data engineering pipeline built on Azure, incorporating real-time ingestion, transformation, structured storage, data modeling, and dashboardingâ€”designed for production.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Azure Data Factory (ADF) for ingestion & orchestration

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) as data lake

Azure Databricks (PySpark, Autoloader, Delta Live Tables)

Delta Lake with Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)

Handling of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD1/SCD2)

Spark Structured Streaming for real-time data

Databricks Unity Catalog for governance

Dimensional modeling / Star Schema for BI

Azure Synapse Analytics Serverless SQL

Power BI dashboards with secure Key Vault + AAD auth

ðŸ“Š Pipeline Overview
1. Architecture & Setup
Designed using Medallion Architecture: Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned), Gold (modeled)

Created Azure infrastructure: ADF pipelines, Databricks workspaces, Unity Catalog, Synapse, ADLS Gen2 zones

2. Data Ingestion
Used Databricks Autoloader for scalable file ingestion

Ingested streaming data via Spark Structured Streaming

3. Transformations
Employed PySpark notebooks and Delta Live Tables for ETL

Implemented SCD Type 1 and Type 2 logic

Built star-schema (fact & dimension tables) in Gold layer


4. Orchestration & Scheduling
Coordinated ADF pipelines to run notebooks and maintain streaming workloads

Modeled orchestration of the full pipeline end-to-end


5. Governance & Security
Managed data catalogs and access via Unity Catalog

Secured credentials using Azure Key Vault and AAD integration


6. Serving & Reporting
Loaded transformed data into Synapse Serverless SQL

Built Power BI dashboards with key metrics and live filtering


ðŸš€ How to Use
Provision Azure resources: ADF, ADLS Gen2, Databricks, Unity Catalog, Synapse, Key Vault, Power BI

Deploy ADF pipeline: Ingest and orchestrate ETL workflows

Run Databricks notebooks / DLT pipelines: process Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold

Model SCDs & star schema in Databricks SQL

Materialize models in Synapse for analytics

Create dashboards in Power BI connecting to Synapse views with secure access

ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters
Mirrors productionâ€‘grade, realâ€‘world data engineering workflows

Includes scalable orchestration, security.
